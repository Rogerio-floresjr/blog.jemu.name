I'm late to the game, I know, but I've been keeping a list of notable shows I watched in 2015 since spring, and I think I owe it to past-me to put that in blog-form.

<!--more-->

Titles which are <strike>striked through</strike> are shows I stopped watching at one point.

## Dig ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/dig))

Primary reason I watched it: Jason Isaacs. I loved him in *Awake*, even though that show was… well, ungracefully ended.  
It's basically a global conspiracy show set primarily in Israel, with a lot of classic conspiracy stuff going on. Themes include archeology, religion and all that jazz. It's okay.

## <strike>American Crime</strike> ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/american-crime-1969))

A show about crimes in different demographics. While the general idea is interesting, I couldn't stand to watch it further due to incredibly unlikable characters. 

## The Jinx ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-jinx-the-life-and-deaths-of-robert-durst))

A true crime documentary, you probably already heard about it. It's about Robert Durst and the skeletons in his closet. Definitely worth a watch. Tim Goodman described it as "the TV version of *Serial*", and I couldn't describe it better.

## The Last Man on Earth ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-last-man-on-earth))

It started out as an interesting setting for a comedy, then it got really annyoing, and then stuff might have gotten better. I haven't started s02 yet, so I don't really know how it turned out, but well. It's there.

## iZombie ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/izombie))

I was a little surprised by iZombie. For one thing: It didn't suck. At it's core it's still a crime procedural, but hey, the protagonist is a zombie, so that's new. While the "big" player in the zombie genre on TV is still *The Walking Dead*, I think it's nice to have other shows like *In the Flesh* or now, iZombie, to take the whole zombie thing and spin it in a different direction.

## Better Call Saul ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/better-call-saul))

I think that's an easy one. If you enjoyed *Breaking Bad*, you're probably interested in exploring the backstory of Saul. To make it short: I liked it, and I hope it'll continue to do fine.

## Humans ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/humans))

Probably my favorite sci-fi show this year. It explores the idea of very realistic robots, called *Synths*, that are supposed to help people – But of course some of them gain consciousness and all kinds of shenanigans happen. It's interesting, watch it.

## Mr. Robot ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/mr-robot))

Favorite non-scifi show this year. I really don't know what to tell you about this show without spoiling it, but let's mention that it portrays hacking realistically. Yeah you read that right. Hacking. Realistic. On TV. 

## Fear the Walking Dead ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/fear-the-walking-dead))

What happened before *The Walking Dead*, in a different part of the country? That's what this show is about. As a person who likes backstory, I really liked it.

## <strike>Minority Report</strike> ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/minority-report))

So horribly, horribly bad.

## Quantico ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/quantico))

Kind of a mix of *Homeland* and… I dunno. FBI, conspiracies, stuff. Okay show.

## <strike>Supergirl</strike> ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/supergirl))

It could have been good. And yes, it's portrayal of female characters is cool and all, but over all it bores me to death. Sorry.

## Jessica Jones ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/marvel-s-jessica-jones))

MARVEL MARVEL MARVEL DAVID TENNANT DAVID TENNANT DAVID TENNANT MARVEL MARVEL

## Daredevil ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/marvel-s-daredevil))

See *Jessica Jones*, remove David Tennant, add other cool stuff.

## The Man in the High Castle ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-man-in-the-high-castle))

I had never seen an alt-history tv show before, and boy did I enjoy it.

## <strike>Blindspot</strike> ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/blindspot))

The Blacklist(ish). Light entertainment, but not really worth a second look.

## Master of None ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/master-of-none))

It feels like a random collection of tales from a modern*ish* person, and… that's pretty much it. Kind of a palette cleanser type show for me. 

## Dark Matter ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/dark-matter))

People wake up on a space ship and have no memories of each other, their lives or identities. Season 1 was interesting, I really really hope it doesn't suck from here on out.

## The Expanse ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-expanse))

All I wanted was a good sci-fi show, and this year I got two. To keep it simple, I have high hopes for The Expanse, there's a *lot* of potential and I can't wait for the rest of the season.

## True Detective (Season 2) ([trakt](https://trakt.tv/shows/true-detective))

I loved season 1 so much, so I feel obligated to mention season 2 because of the high hopes I had, but boy do I not care at all for anyone in season 2. I haven't even finished watching it yet.  
This saddens me.
