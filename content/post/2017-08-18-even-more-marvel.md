Awwwwwyeeeah, time for another round of *Marvel/Netflix local reluctant more ore less heavily troubled heroes of the people*<sup>TM</sup> up in here.

It's our favorite guy with red bondage outfit, our favorite foul-mouthed functioning(ish) alcoholic, our favorite non-green conscious Hulk, and the scrawny dude with the weird culutral appropriation vibes going on. Also, his fist is glow-in-the-dark kinda.   

Before I start, here's my ranking of the protaginists so far:

1. Jessica Jones
2. Matt
3. Luke and Claire
4. Foggy
5. Most others
6. The rich white guy with the gimmick hand and the *I've been through a lot*-voice

## Assorted notes

I kinda watched the whole thing in one go, it's only 8 episodes anyway, so here's a bunch of notes.

### e01-e03

- Awww man, I need more Foggy
- Jessica Jones <3
- Luke telling white kid about privilege 👍
- Sidekick women being side-sidekicks, could need less sidekicking and more ass-kicking :/

### e04 

- Characterization by dinner, classic
- Stick tells Danny he's a dumbass, and I appreciate that
- How did Black Sky know when Alexandra made the proper statement for her dramatic entran— oh wait Jessica topped it, nevermind
- Did I mention how I think Jessica Jones is the best thing to come out of the Marvel/Netflix thing?

### e05

- Ah yes, the old "Protagonist tries to talk brainwashed old friend/lover back to reality through the magic of love"-thing, isn't it?
- Goddammit *Elektra* still sounds like a porn star super villain
- Mme Gao is awesome, yet terrifying[^1]
- The whole *"my child"*-thing is kind of creeping me out by now
- Stop trying to make me care about Elektra, it's not going to happen
- Right, boredom fist has a lady sidekick, I wish she was character
- Oh nevermind, the gave her the *conflicted about sensei* thing, I forgot
- "Nice ears" … did I mention I love Jessica?
- Stick <3
- Still not caring about Elektra ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

### e06

- Yeah yeah, reluctant hero troop fights among themselves, yadda yadda, they'll work together eventually and we all know it
- Danny m(
- Okay, maybe now I care about Elektra a little, even if her name sounds like *electric nachos*[^2]

### e07

- I'm tired of the *"we are the law here, you need to tell us everything"*-shit stalling the plot.
- "There is no plan" - "I can tell" something something burn center
- Heros have to destroy part of the city they're trying to protect. 
- Yes, soft-avengering. Less aliens, more magic ninjas.

### e08

- "I'm not hugging you" – Luke is just a treasure.
- Looks like Colleen at least gets her expected closure, so there's that
- Had to [google how her name is spelled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)#Main), and wait, *"Misty Knight"*? Oh come on. She's getting herself a hero outfit, right? (Addendum: She now lost her arm, so yeah, I'll assume that might be origin story stuff)
- "It's 'Iron *Fist*'" - "I know" – Jessica <3
- Ah, the classic quantum bomb timer, where time moves slower when you don't look at it
- Something tells me that a collapsing building would have a bigger radius of destruction than that, but oh well
- Yeah, not buying that implied off-screen death, no emotional impact was had[^3].
- Assuming *"Alias Investigations"* is a comic thing? Welp, don't care as long as there's more Jessica Jones.
- *So* not surprised.
