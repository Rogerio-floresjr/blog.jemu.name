[Last time I mentioned](http://blog.jemu.name/lolz/2016/03/theres-a-new-bot-in-town/) how I set up [@whatever_ebooks](https://twitter.com/whatever_ebooks), a bot that's basically an amalgamation of a part of my twitter social circle.  
But why stop there?  
Because it's a shitty idea and nobody gives a fuck.  
But it's not like I've let that ever stop me. 

So, here's a fresh round of stuff for you to enjoy for 5 seconds and then forget about:

- [@toptweets_ger](https://twitter.com/toptweets_ger):
    - A bot that's fed some of the popular jokey twitter people in the German twitterverse. 
- [@fefe_ebooks](https://twitter.com/fefe_ebooks):
    - While I still can't believe nobody has done this before apparently, I just did it. I scraped [fefe's blog](https://blog.fefe.de) and used that corpus for a twitter bot. Because that's what I do these days.
- [@botoficeandfire](https://twitter.com/botoficeandfire):
    - Next in the round of twitter bots made with [twitter_ebooks](https://github.com/mispy/twitter_ebooks) that are not actually twitter accounts. Yeah, I used all the *A Song of Ice and Fire* books in plaintext, which I had lying around anyway, and fed them to the bot. And now there's that. 


All the bots reply to mentions and DMs, and they're all are powered by [mispy's ruby gem](https://github.com/mispy/twitter_ebooks), which is probably not ideal for at least two of the bots above, but at least I have a grasp of the basic usage and I'm too lazy to spend any more time on projects like this.

Anyway, that's my gift to humankind for this week.  
Have fun.
