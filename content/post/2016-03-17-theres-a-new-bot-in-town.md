title: There's a New Bot in Town
---

Well hello there.

For no particular reason whatsoever, I set up a new [twitter bot](https://twitter.com/whatever_ebooks) that's fed by some of the people in my extended twittersphere. You can look if you're in the mix in [the bot's followings](https://twitter.com/whatever_ebooks/following).

If you think that's a shitty idea [^1], you can message me in any way you care and tell me to GTFO.

If you're looking for more backstory, I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you, but maybe [somewhere here](https://twitter.com/Jemus42/status/710368111367745537) is the place to look.

[^1]: Let's face it, you're right.
