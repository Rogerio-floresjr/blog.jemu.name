```{r}
source(here::here("_post-setup.R"))
```

```{r chunkname, hugoopts=list(alt="alternative text please make it informative", caption="this is what this image shows, write it here or in the paragraph after the image as you prefer")} 
library(ggplot2)
library(tadaathemes)
library(hrbrthemes)

```{r devs-episode-ratings, hugoopts=list(caption = "My glorious plot")}
library(tRakt)
library(dplyr)
library(ggrepel)

    segment.color = "#999999",

```


Does it do math? Here's $f(x) = x^2$.  
Also inline: $\sigma(x) = \max(0, x)$


\begin{align}
\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y
\end{align}


## Here's a heading

Maybe a table?

```{r}
library(kableExtra)

iris %>%
  head(20) %>%
  mutate(id = seq_along(Species) * 10) %>%
  kable(caption = "My nice looking table") %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center")
```
