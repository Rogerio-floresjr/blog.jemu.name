## About me

I'm Lukas, or jemus42, or jemsu, or whatever.  
My home on the internet is either my [twitter account](https://twitter.com/jemus42) and [Mastodon account](https://misanthropy.wang/@jemus42) respectively, or this [landing(ish) page(ish) I made all by myself(ish)](https://quantenbrot.de).  

I'm primarily interested in tv shows, data analysis and being socially awkward.  
If you want to contact me, I really wouldn't know why, but you can try `jemus42@quantenbrot.de`

## This Site

This is made with [hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), using [my fork](https://github.com/jemus42/hugo-redlounge-jemsu) of the [Red Lounge theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/redlounge/) which I've tweaked in some minor and major ways.  
It's not really in a state where I could publish it, but it's on GitHub for those interested.
