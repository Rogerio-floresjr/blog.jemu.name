## About me

I'm Lukas, or jemus42, or jemsu, or whatever.  
My home on the internet is either my [twitter account](https://twitter.com/jemus42) or this [landing(ish) page(ish) I made all by myself(ish)](https://quantenbrot.de).  

I'm primarily interested in tv shows, data analysis and being socially awkward.  
If you want to contact me, I really wouldn't know why, but you can try `jemus42@quantenbrot.de`

## About this site

This is made with [hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), using the [the lithium theme as previously forked by yihui theme](https://github.com/jemus42/hugo-lithium-theme-jms) which I modified in some small ways to better fit by needs. Basically I just added some CSS for nicer tables (because of the data analysis thing) and tweaked image display as well as some other minor things.  
I wanted to use my old redlounge theme, but until I figure out how to make it compatible with the recent versions of hugo, this one will have to do.

â€¦Oh no wait I fixed the 3 broken lines in [my redlounge fork](https://github.com/jemus42/hugo-redlounge-jemsu) and now it works. Nevermind.
