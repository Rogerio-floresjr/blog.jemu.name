# blog.jemu.name

Just a blog. Running on [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) and [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)

Currently using [beautifulhugo](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo) as a theme with some modifications via `static/css/jemus.css` and mildly tweaked `layouts/` components.  

## Modifications to the base theme made (to be documented properly):

- Misc CSS adjustments (shoddily DIY'd)
- Taxonomies for R packages and shows (needs more understanding of hugo taxonomies)
- Added prism.js for syntax highlighting
- Tweaked the R syntax highlighting to highlight infix operators like `%>%` (see `static/js/prism.r.js`)
