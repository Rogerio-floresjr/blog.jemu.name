# blog.jemu.name

Just a blog. Running on [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) and [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)

The theme is not included due to a lack of foresight and understanding of git submodules on my part, 
but you can find it [on GitHub as well](https://github.com/jemus42/hugo-redlounge-jemsu/).

My actual blogposts are sporadically added to this repository as well, because Idunno, it seemed like a thing to do.
